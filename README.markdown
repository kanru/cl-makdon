CL-MAKDON - A Markdown like simple markup language
==================================================

About
-----

CL-MAKDON is an attempt to implement a simple and extensible yet close
enough to the original Markdown markup language.

The output of CL-MAKDON is not text strings but list of conses that
can be processed by any CL-WHO compatible markup generation library.

In the beginning it will focus on the naive interpretation of Markdown
definition and will not attempt to handle the corner cases.
